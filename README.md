# Sudoku Solver

### About
This repository contains a python program which has the ability to solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle. 

It is personal project that I created after gaining an interest in this form of puzzle.

This project utilises the [Backtracking Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking).

## Installation
In order to run this program, you will have to download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

[Refer to this website for the next steps](https://www.pythoncentral.io/execute-python-script-file-shell/). 

## Potential Upgrades

* Enabling the program to solve Sudoku puzzles of different sizes
* Generating Sudoku puzzles and allows the user to attempt them before using the solver
